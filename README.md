The Tic Tac Toe game is a game for two players, called "X" and "O", who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeded in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The Tic Tac Toe is a great way to pass your free time whether you're standing in a line or spending time with your kids. Stop wasting paper and save trees. Because of the simplicity of Tic Tac Toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence.

The project is divided into three modules :-
<ul>
  <li>Online mode</li>
  <li>Player v Android Mode</li>
  <li>Multiplayer Mode</li>
</ul>

This is the main dashboard of the app; this activity allows user to select many options as buttons. Using media player, I have added button pop sound when the button clicked. I have also added click back twice to exit the in this activity using function onBackPressed ().
